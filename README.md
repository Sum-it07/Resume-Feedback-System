# Resume Feedback System

A rule-based AI system that analyzes a resume against required job skills and provides
structured feedback.

## Features
- Skill extraction using regex and keyword matching
- Skill normalization and suppression (e.g., C vs C++)
- Skill matching and coverage calculation
- Human-readable resume feedback

## Approach
This project uses deterministic, explainable rules instead of machine learning to ensure
transparency and correctness.

## Tech
- Python
- Regular Expressions
- Git

## Status
Completed (rule-based baseline)
